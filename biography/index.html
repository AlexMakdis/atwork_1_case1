            <div class="introduction">
                <p>Arne Quinze is a Belgian contemporary artist, painter and sculptor. His work involves everything from
                    small drawings and paintings, medium-sized sculptures to massive installations. Quinze was born in
                    Belgium in 1971 and currently lives and works in Sint-Martens-Latem, a town near the Belgian city of
                    Ghent. His early career in the 1980s was as a graffiti artist, without having completed an official
                    art education. He always questioned the role of our cities and started his search for cities to
                    become open air museums. His work quickly evolved from Street Art to Public Art with recurring
                    themes as social interaction, urbanisation and diversity.

            <p>The gigantic wooden construction entitled Uchronia, which he and his team built in the Nevada desert
                (USA) for the 2006 Burning Man festival, emphasized his pursuit for culture and nature to coexist. This
                was followed by numerous sculptures and exhibitions that included both large installations and small
                paintings and sculptures. At the present time, many of his installations are considered to be landmarks
                that present a different dynamic for urban development: In Paris, Shanghai, Beirut, Washington DC,
                Brussels, Mumbai, Sao Paolo,… Quinze has been intervening in cities now for over 25 years, and many
                projects are still lined up to be finalised.</p>

                        a vigorous dialogue. His unconventional public installations have challenged perceptions in

        <h2>The beauty of nature</h2>
        <p>Arne Quinze's sculptures come into being after numerous personal encounters with the unbridled beauty of
            nature. They symbolise his reflection on todays growing differences between the diversity of nature and the
            ongoing expansion of monotone cities.</p>
        <p>While continuously unraveling the physical processes of complex demographies they react to all impulses in
            order to keep equilibrium. Resulting in a play of attraction and rejection that shapes the organic forms and
            electric bright colours. At first glance they seem vulnerable, but they wil persist a vigour dialogue just
            like nature.’</p>
        <p>In every culture Quinze comes across, he is fueled by overwhelming optimism. Every new creative breed
            captures his research and study&nbsp;on interaction, and urban movement expressing the&nbsp;continuously
            evolution of human beings and their environment. Besides building architectural&nbsp;sculptures, he creates
            complex art pieces and video installations inscribing his&nbsp;vision in society of how people see
            themselves and society. Works
            as&nbsp;<i>Bidonvilles</i>,&nbsp;<i>Stilthouses</i>,&nbsp;<i>Chaos</i>,&nbsp;<i>My Home My House My
                Stilthouse</i>,&nbsp;<i>My Safe Garden, Natural Chaos&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Natural Chaos
                Satellites&nbsp;</i>have been shown on several exhibitions.&nbsp;<i></i></p>

                    <h2>Diversity
                    </h2>
                    <p>In each of Arne Quinze’s recent works we encounter a seemingly chaotic confrontation between
                        individual elements that form an integral part of a biotope that is created in laboratory
                        conditions and is multiplied organically. The variety of colour and form is as wide as the
                        viewer’s imagination. The artist hereby depicts a society as a coherent and intact ecosystem, a
                        sampling of nature, which is his chief inspiration. In this way, the sculptures and
                        installations call for a retention of diversity and pluralism, and for experiment and
                        cross-fertilisation. This is a clear indictment of the present trend towards monocultures and
                        soured relations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Bringing people back together again: according to Quinze, this should be the ultimate objective
                        of public art. After an initial surprising impression, a sculpture is able to refine the
                        threshold of acceptance for the passer-by, by flying in the face of the norm – norms lead only
                        to monotonous grey cities. Just as in the artworks, and just as in nature, cities should aim for
                        a symbiosis of numerous organisms, which in their turn fuel conversation and consequently the
                        conservation of their future.
                    </p>
                    <p>In fact the artist quite literally challenges monocultures. With his garden as a scale model, an
                        explosion of life with the rampant splendour of flowers, the pursuit of variation and diversity
                        is both a statement and a leitmotiv that runs through his work. The fact that we have already
                        destroyed 30% of existing flora and fauna since Quinze’s birth in 1971 is abhorrent to him. It
                        is in everyone’s interest to protect and restore ecosystems.
